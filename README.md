# Java-
This is a simple java program I made to practice object oriented coding principles and graphical user interfaces in java. The purpose of this 
program is to simulate an user accesssing a shopping window, their username,password, name and address is requested as input. Their password and username are read from a decrypted text file 
that the user edits and stores on their computer. The password file is decrypted by the program and is compared with the users input, if it is a match the program accepts
the order and the user is displayed the message that their order was received. The graphical components such as the company name and logo as well as the save and clear button
are rendered through the java.awt and java.swing libraries.
